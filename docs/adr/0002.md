# ADR 0002: Internal communications via gRPC + Dapr

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The platform must stay consistent between modular monolith and microservice modes while minimising coupling.

## Decision
Use gRPC as the synchronous protocol with Dapr service invocation. `.proto` contracts are versioned and reusable.

## Consequences
- Strongly typed contracts reusable by clients and servers.
- Requires managing generated packages for frontend/edge consumers.
- Adds complexity for environments without gRPC support → REST gateway fallback.
