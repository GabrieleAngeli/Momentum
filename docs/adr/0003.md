# ADR 0003: Kafka as event-driven backbone

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need a highly scalable bus compatible with Dapr to orchestrate telemetry events across the modular monolith and future microservices.

## Decision
Adopt Kafka with Dapr pub/sub. Main topics: `telemetry.input`, `telemetry.ingested`.

## Consequences
- Native Dapr support and a rich tooling ecosystem.
- Requires managed cluster operations in production.
- Needs a schema registry for evolution (TODO).
