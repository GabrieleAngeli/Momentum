# ADR 0001: Use .NET Aspire with Dapr for local orchestration

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Multiple services need local orchestration with Dapr sidecars and dependencies such as Kafka and Timescale while maintaining parity with the modular monolith runtime.

## Decision
Adopt the .NET Aspire AppHost to define local infrastructure and Dapr sidecars, keeping the monolith and microservice topologies consistent.

## Consequences
- Simplified local startup via `dotnet run` on the AppHost.
- Ability to define infrastructure dependencies as code.
- Requires preview SDKs while Aspire remains in preview.
