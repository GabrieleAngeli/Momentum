# ADR 0005: TimescaleDB + Apache Ignite for hybrid storage

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The platform needs both historical time-series persistence and low-latency realtime responses for modular monolith scenarios and extracted services.

## Decision
Use TimescaleDB for historical storage and Apache Ignite as the shared data grid/cache.

## Consequences
- Optimised analytical queries on Timescale.
- Ignite provides near-cache and in-memory computations.
- Requires dedicated orchestration and monitoring.
