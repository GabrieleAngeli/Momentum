# ADR 0004: SignalR for realtime notifications

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Operators must receive real-time updates without relying on polling.

## Decision
Use SignalR as the realtime channel exposed by web-backend-core, integrated with the notifier service.

## Consequences
- Angular client integrates via `@microsoft/signalr`.
- Requires sticky sessions or a backplane for horizontal scale (Azure SignalR / Redis).
